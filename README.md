# For Data Mining

Just few months ago, the online AlphaGo[1] Go Game computer model beat all the top Go gamers, the news shocked the world in such a way that computer now can show the advantage in many ways than human, some even can say that computer is smarter than human being now.  Go Game has been considered one of the toughest games reflecting the power of the human brain.  Not until half year ago, there was not such a computer model can beat human in the Go game; however, this has been the history.  

The winning logic behind is the advance of the human technology, such as in the way of the evolution of the machining learning, where the deep learning and deep mind algorithm is the new extension of machine learning and creates the AlphaGo.  

It has been estimated that the computer can’t win the Go Game at least within 5~10 years; however, the computer technology evolves so quick that it is faster than human’s imagination.  For example, just within less than six months, the initial AlphaGo model is able to learn so quick that initially it only beat the middle tie Go gamers, then suddenly it can beat all the top Go gamers in next 6~12 months. 

Lectured by Professor Surendra Sarnikar [2] at California State University, East Bay, I am about finishing the graduate course – ITM 6285, Data Mining, the final project for the class will be focused on some topics of the driverless car.   A driverless car (also known as autonomous car, auto, self-driving car, robotic car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input [3], the developments of the driverless car require extensive machine learning, data mining and all other related high-tech elements, where it is very similar to the AlphaGo development.  Though occasionally we can see the google driverless car on the road, most of us still think the mature of the driverless car will be in a long future; however, just by learning from the AlphaGo instance, driverless car in everywhere might just happen within next 10 years.  10-year is a short period for car usage, most of the car can last 15 years and very commonly many car can last more than twenty years.  In some opinions, a 10-year-old car is just like a new car since all the components, especially many metal and mechanical parts inside the car are still in the mid-way of their life and in good shape.

The technology always changes the ways we are living and thinking, imaging how about we have no internet and cell phone today, this will be the same feeling after the driverless car becomes popular and enter each family, then people can’t live without the driverless car.  So how do people feel about the driverless car toady?  How would the people feel in the near future, for example, in 2027, a ten-year period from now on?  And what would be every millstone the driverless car is going to develop? 

Unlike the traditional way, nowadays we can do the survey over the internet and gain our insight regarding the topics we are searching for (this is also another proving that technology is changing our way of living and thinking in every respect).  Besides we google the feedback and find every relevant forum, we can find our answer from twitter.
